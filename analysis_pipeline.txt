Experiment 1 - analysis pipeline

#pre-processing
1. Run BIDS curation tool on FlyWheel
2. Use FlyWheel to download data
3. Run preprocessing to create derivative and cov directories, de-skull anat, create motion spike covs
4. Run changeOut script to copy 1stlevel.fsf/HighLevel.fsf files to new subs.
	a. Run once for with '_roi' suffix and once with no suffix '' to create 4-run localizer feats and 2-run experimental feats
5. Copy over cov files
6. Run parcel2anat to register parcels to individual subject space
7. Run create_rois to create rois from contrasts + parcels
8. Run 1stlevel2anat to register 1stlevel stat file to standard, to be used later for cross-val
9. Run create_roi_sphere for create 6mm spherical ROIs centered on the peak
